### Data Preprocessing Project Template

This repository provides a comprehensive template for data preprocessing tasks essential for machine learning projects. The template follows a structured approach to ensure data quality and readiness for model building. It covers various aspects of data preprocessing, including:

#### Key Features:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - **Handling Missing Values:** Techniques such as imputation, deletion, and using models to predict missing values.
   - **Removing Duplicates:** Identifying and removing duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
   - **Correcting Inconsistencies:** Standardizing formats and correcting erroneous data entries.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - **Normalization:** Scaling features to a standard range, typically [0, 1], to ensure uniformity.
   - **Standardization:** Adjusting data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical variables into numerical formats using one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to capture more information for the models.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Summary Statistics:** Descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution.
   - **Visualizations:** Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns and relationships.
   - **Correlation Analysis:** Assessing the relationships between features to detect multicollinearity and feature importance.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - **Univariate Selection:** Statistical tests to select features with strong relationships with the output variable.
   - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Iteratively removing features and building models to identify the most significant features.
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Dimensionality reduction to transform features into a set of linearly uncorrelated components.

5. **Data Preparation for Modeling:**
   - **Splitting Data:** Dividing data into training, validation, and test sets.
   - **Balancing Classes:** Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance.
   - **Pipeline Creation:** Building preprocessing pipelines for reproducibility and efficient workflow.

6. **Documentation:**
   - **Detailed Notebooks:** Comprehensive Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations and code snippets for each preprocessing task.
   - **Code Comments:** Inline comments to clarify the purpose and functionality of code blocks.
   - **README Files:** Instructions and guidelines on how to use the template effectively.

Usage:

This template is designed to streamline the preprocessing phase of machine learning projects, providing a robust foundation for building accurate and reliable models. By following this template, users can ensure their data is well-prepared, leading to better model performance and insights.
